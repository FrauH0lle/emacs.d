## Commit Message Guidelines

- Follow [Conventional Commits](www.conventionalcommits.org)
- Types:
  - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts.
  - docs: Documentation only changes.
  - feat: A new feature.
  - fix: A bug fix.
  - pkg: Addition of package or version change.
  - perf: A code change that improves performance.
  - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
  - revert: Undoes a previous change. Must be followed by the full subject of
    the reverted commit (and add Revert HASH to FOOTER).
  - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space,
    formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
  - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
  - tweak: Code changes that changes defaults and user-facing behavior, but not
    drastically.
