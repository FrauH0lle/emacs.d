# Commit Messages

The guidelines are an adaptation from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).

## Basic format:
```
type(component): brief description (50-72 chars)

* [filename].[ext] ([affected-items]): [Description of changes]
  [Additional context and rationale]
  [Limitations or future implications]
  
[Optional footer(s)]
```

## Guidelines

1. Start with the type, the optional package/component/scope name within
   parenthesis followed by a colon and a brief title. The first word of the
   title should not be capitalized.
   - Example: `feat(parser): add finite state machine`
   - Example: `fix(api): prevent racing of requests`
   
   1. Append a `!` after the type/scope if the commit introduces a breaking
      change
   
2. For files changed, list them in parentheses followed by affected
   functions/variables:

   ```
   * file.ext (function1, function2, variable1): Description
   ```

3. Write the main description in present tense, explaining:
   - What changed
   - Why it changed (rationale)
   - Any limitations or caveats
   - Future implications if relevant

4. When multiple files are changed, list each one with its own bullet point and
   description:

   ```
   * file1.ext (functions): Description
   * file2.ext (functions): Related changes
   ```

5. For implementation details that affect multiple components, explain shared
   changes once and use "Ditto" for repeated similar changes:

   ```
   * component1.ext: Main change description
   * component2.ext: Ditto
   ```

6. Include important context about:
   - Experimental features or APIs
   - Testing configurations
   - Known limitations
   - Future plans or potential changes

7. Write descriptions that are clear enough to be understood without needing to
   look at the code, while still being concise

8. One or more footers may be provided one blank line after the body. Each
   footer must consist of a word token, followed by a `:<space>` separator,
   followed by a string value (see [git trailer
   convention](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers)). A footerâ€™s
   token must use `-` in place of whitespace characters, e.g., `Acked-by`. An
   exception is made for `BREAKING CHANGE`, which may also be used as a token.
   
   ```
   chore!: drop support for Node 6

   BREAKING CHANGE: use JavaScript features not available in Node 6.

## Notes:

- Start with type(scope): following Conventional Commits
- Include BREAKING CHANGE: in body for breaking changes
- Follow with detailed file-by-file changes
- Use present tense for descriptions
- Include rationale for non-obvious changes
- Mention experimental features or limitations
- Use "Ditto" for repeated changes across files
- Keep consistent formatting with blank lines between sections

## Examples:

### Feature addition example

```
feat(gptel): add finite state machine

* gptel.el (gptel-fsm, gptel--fsm-transition, gptel--fsm-next): 
  Add a state machine and transition system to handle dynamic control flows.
  This allows for more complex interactions like multi-turn requests
  with tool-use support.
  
  Implementation is generic and experimental - API may change in future.

BREAKING CHANGE: FSM implementation changes request handling flow
```

### Bug fix example

```
fix(gptel-rewrite): ensure point remains in rewrite region

* gptel-rewrite.el (gptel--suffix-rewrite): Ensure cursor stays
  in rewrite region after sending request.
  Optimizes UX for rewrite dispatch menu activation.
```

### Multiple file changes example

```
feat(gptel): implement tool use support

* gptel.el (gptel-request, gptel-use-tools, gptel-tools): Add user
  options for tool management and toggle functionality.
  Currently an all-or-nothing setting for testing purposes.

* gptel-openai.el (gptel--request-data): Add tool payload support
  when enabled.

* gptel-ollama.el (gptel--request-data): Ditto. Disable streaming
  for tool-use compatibility.
```
