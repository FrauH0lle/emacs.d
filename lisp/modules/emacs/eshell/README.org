* Configuration
 #+begin_src elisp
;; See:
;;   + `+eshell/here': open eshell in the current window
;;   + `+eshell/toggle': toggles an eshell popup
;;   + `+eshell/frame': converts the current frame into an eshell-dedicated
;;   frame. Once the last eshell process is killed, the old frame configuration
;;   is restored.

  (expand-file-name "eshell/" zenit-local-conf-dir)
  "Where to store eshell configuration files, as opposed to
`eshell-directory-name', which is where Emacs will store
temporary/data files.")

(defvar eshell-directory-name (concat zenit-data-dir "eshell")
  "Where to store temporary/data files, as opposed to
`eshell-config-dir',which is where Emacs will store eshell
configuration files.")

(defvar +eshell-enable-new-shell-on-split t
  "If non-nil, spawn a new eshell session after splitting from an
eshell buffer.")

(defvar +eshell-kill-window-on-exit nil

buffers.")

    ("clear" "clear-scrollback")) ; more sensible than default
  "An alist of default eshell aliases, meant to emulate useful shell
utilities,like fasd and bd. Note that you may overwrite these in
your `eshell-aliases-file'. This is here to provide an
alternative, elisp-centric way to define your aliases.

You should use `set-eshell-alias!' to change this.")
