;; When creating a new process in Emacs, you have two options: synchronous or
;; asynchronous. Async processes have historically been really slow over TRAMP,

;; recent version of TRAMP have added a feature called direct async process that
;; makes this significantly faster. This feature alone will take many packages
;; (like magit or git-gutter) from completely unusable to bearable over TRAMP.
