#+created: 2024-06-24

* Description :unfold:
Display a diff of the current file (against HEAD) in the fringe.

** Module flags
- +pretty ::
  Apply some stylistic defaults to the fringe that present the diff in the
  fringe as thin bars, taking after the modern look of the git-gutter plugin in
  VSCode and Sublime Text. However, this will look bad with themes that invert
  the foreground/background of diff-hlâ€™s faces (like modus-themes does).
