#+title: :ui workspaces
#+created: 2024-06-15

* Description :unfold:
Provides workspaces powered by ~persp-mode~ and Tab Bars.

Each tab represents a workspace and has a separate window configuration and
buffer list. The workspaces are shared among frames but isolated via
~tab-bar-mode~. They can be moved around the open frames.

Running ~make-frame~ interactively will open the current buffer in a new frame,
inheriting the current workspace.

Emacs client will open a new workspace in a new frame.

All frames and their workspaces can be saved and restored between sessions.

This module depends on ~:ui tabs~.
